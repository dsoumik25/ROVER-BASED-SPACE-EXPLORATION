# ROVER-BASED-SPACE-EXPLORATION
Contains the algorithms and processes included in the project.
1. Problem Definition and Data Collection:
The goal of the AI model is to predict moisture content in soil based on sensor data.
Sensors involved:
Soil moisture sensor (primary sensor).
Supporting sensors: temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., to provide additional environmental context.
Data points: Sensor data collected at each position the rover travels to, including moisture levels, temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.
The target variable (output) is the moisture content (binary or continuous, depending on how you want to define moisture detection).
2. Preprocessing the Data:
Noise Removal: Sensor data often contains noise (irregular or erroneous readings).
Apply a Kalman Filter or Moving Average Filter to smooth sensor data over time.
Normalization: Scale the data so that features like temperature, pressure, and moisture are on a similar scale, preventing any one feature from disproportionately influencing the model. Use techniques like Min-Max Scaling.
python

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(raw_data)
3. Feature Engineering:
Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features from the raw sensor data to enhance model accuracy.
Moving averages of sensor readings over time.
Temperature-moisture interaction: Higher temperatures can affect moisture levels.
Gradient of moisture levels over space and time to detect patterns or anomalies.
Feature Selection: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset if necessary, removing less relevant features.
python

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=5)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)
5. Model Selection:
You can apply different machine learning models depending on the complexity of the data and the requirements.

Option 1: Decision Tree/Random Forest
Decision Trees and Random Forests are good choices for classification problems where patterns are non-linear and the dataset is relatively small. Random Forests perform well in noisy environments.
python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Option 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are also suitable for smaller datasets, especially for binary classification (moisture/no moisture).
python

from sklearn.svm import SVC
model = SVC(kernel='rbf')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Option 3: Neural Networks (Optional for Larger Dataset)
For larger datasets and more complex non-linear patterns, you may opt for a Neural Network (NN).
python

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=input_dim, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # For binary classification

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32)
5. Model Training:
Splitting the Dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (usually 80% training, 20% testing).
python

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Model Fitting: Train the chosen machine learning model using the training data.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
python

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
print(f"Cross-validation accuracy: {scores.mean()}")
6. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate its performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
python

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
python

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = {'max_depth': [5, 10, 15], 'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
7. Real-Time AI Model Deployment:
Model Deployment: Once the AI model is trained and tested, integrate it into the roverâ€™s onboard system to make predictions in real-time.
Real-time Prediction Loop: As the rover moves, collect sensor data at each location, preprocess it, and pass it through the trained AI model to predict whether moisture is present.
python

def predict_moisture(sensor_data):
    # Preprocess incoming data
    processed_data = preprocess(sensor_data)
    # Predict using the trained model
    return model.predict(processed_data)
Feedback Mechanism: If moisture is detected, the rover could adjust its behavior, such as halting for further analysis or sending data to the control station.
8. Adaptive Learning and Retraining:
Continuous Learning: Periodically retrain the AI model using new data collected by the rover in different environmental conditions.
Update the dataset with new readings.
Fine-tune or re-train the model to improve performance.
9. Data Aggregation and Post-Processing:
Once the rover detects moisture, it aggregates data from various sensor readings (e.g., average moisture levels over a specific area).
This data is then transmitted back to Earth or stored locally, and the AI could generate insights on moisture distribution over time.
AI Algorithm Summary:
Data Preprocessing:
